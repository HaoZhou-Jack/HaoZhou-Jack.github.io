## About Me ##
I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents (CCFEA)](https://www.google.com/search?q=ccfea&oq=ccfea&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i30j0i10i30i625j0i30i625l2j0i30j69i59j69i61.1477j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), of the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/). I started my PhD in October 2019 under [Dr Maria Kyropoulou](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/kyrop21400/maria-kyropoulou) and [Dr Panagiotis Kanellopoulos](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/kanel33803/panagiotis-kanellopoulos)' supervision. My studies are funded by a scholarship by the University of Essex. Prior to that, I successfully received an MSc in [Computational Finance](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg00496/1/msc-computational-finance) from the University of Essex, UK, and an MSc in [Asset Evaluation](http://econ.jxufe.edu.cn/news-show-2051.html) from the [Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics](http://www.jxufe.edu.cn/), China. 


 My research interests lie at the intersection of **algorithmic game theory**, **financial network theory** and **machine learning**. I am highly interested in reasoning about the strategic behaviours in large-scale financial networks from both game-theoretic and empirical perspectives, as well as the applications of reinforcement learning techniques in finance and economics. I am also conducting research on portfolio optimization and asset management in financial networks using deep learning.
